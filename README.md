This chat demo was created with React, Redux, Node, Express and Socket.io as the main components of the application. It uses Material-ui as the front end display.

You can download this demo, install all the necessary node packages and run it in your browser by going to the chat folder and running `npm start` and then opening a second command line and going to chat/server and running `node app`. A production build is also provided.

Coming soon: a live version on a web server is coming soon.
